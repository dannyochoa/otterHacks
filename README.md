# otterHacks

**Inspiration:**
With this project, we wanted to create a solution to detect diseases in plants.

**What it does:**
It reads an URL or uploads a file image to the website. The image will be processed to the website where the program will determine if the leave is potentially healthy or unhealthy. A new image with the rot highlighted will be generated. The results will be then displayed on the website with specific percentages and values. (percent of leaf inflicted with rot/ probability that image is of a rotting plant)

**How I built it:**
Python, HTML, Flask, CSS, OpenCV, TensorFlow

**Challenges we ran into:**
Working with HTML and Flask to update the generated image.

**Accomplishments that we are proud of:**
Successfully identifying a leaf that is rotten vs healthy vs not a leaf Successfully highlighting rot location on leaves.

**What I learned:**
HTML + Flask Image Recognition

**What's next for Plant Recognition:**
More training to recognize rot more accurately Expanding to different plants and diseases Cleaner HTML + Flask integration
